Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Stock Hawk is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Stock Hawk itself.

# Ground Rules

## Responsibilities

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep changes as small as possible.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. 
* Make sure to follow our [code quality guidelines](https://github.com/therajanmaurya/Stock-Hawk#code-quality).

# Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started

Take a look at the general overview of the [architecture](https://github.com/therajanmaurya/Stock-Hawk#architecture).

## Before opening your pull request

Make sure [our tests](https://github.com/therajanmaurya/Stock-Hawk#tests) and [our code analysis](https://github.com/therajanmaurya/Stock-Hawk#code-analysis-tools) are passing. You can run both with the following:

# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Stock Hawk are you using?

3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Stock Hawk, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Stock Hawk has today have been added because our users saw the need. [Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub](https://github.com/therajanmaurya/Stock-Hawk/issues) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
